# Webscraping for Mars Data:

> This project uses webscraping to collect data from a website.
>
> Note that the file part_2_mars_weather.ipynb has a very long output in html. If you scroll past that to the bottom, there are Pandas dataframe and Python plots to visualize and organize data.
>
> I used matplotlib to plot the graphs in Python.
